# WorkAround Explorer Project

For this Codecademy project, we were tasked with assisting WorkAround, a fictitious research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry, create a new application to make their data more easily viewable. This was accomplished with the use of importing / exporting JavaScript ES6 modules.

## Objective

WorkAround wanted their web app - named WorkAround Explorer - to allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry and view the following information:

* The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
* The industry average for the chosen role.
* The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
* The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.
